---

When the KoomBook is connected to the internet with an [Ethernet cable or WiFi](comment-mettre-a-jour-le-koombook), it will search the Bibliothèques Sans Frontières (Libraries Without Borders [file server](https://githu
b.com/ideascube/ansiblecube/tree/oneUpdateFile) for updates.  If there are any available, they will be applied to the KoomBook.  Possible updates include:

* Updates to software for the Linux operating system, which can vary from a few hundred KB to several dozen MB. 
* Updates to the Ideascube software, which uses about 20 MB.
* Content updates, which can use between several hundred MB and more than a dozen GB.  However, these are quite rare and only done upon request.  

**In the majority of cases, connecting to the internet and installing available updates consumes about 20 MB**

These automatic updates can be disactivated if you wish.
