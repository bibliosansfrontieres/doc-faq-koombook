All the content posted in the KoomBook (in the Blog and the Media Center) is stored locally.  There is not currently a system to synchronize or publish this content to the internet.

Furthermore, no system to backup the content exists or is currently expected.  Your locally-saved data is thus susceptible to being permanently lost if the KoomBook is lost or if the storage system (SSD disk) is harmed too badly to recuperate the files.
