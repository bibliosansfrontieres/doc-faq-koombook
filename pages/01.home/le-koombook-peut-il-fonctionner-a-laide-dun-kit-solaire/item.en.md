|  | 20 W Kit | 65 W Kit |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| Can I recharge the battery from an outlet? | Yes, but you need a 230-V ac adapter to USB 5-V (like a telephone charger) | Yes |
| Charging time through main power | approximately 6 h _\(to be confirmed\)_ | 6 h |
| Charging time through solar panels | 5 h 15 \(less under full sunlight\) | X min |
| Can I charge the battery while also charging the KoomBook or tablets? | No | No |
| How many devices can be fully charged at once? | Theoretically 1 | X |
| How many devices can be charged half way at once? | Theoretically 2 | X |
| Maximum output from solar panel | 5.5 V | 19 V |
| Maximum output intensity from solar panel | 2.1 A, but power drops quickly | 3 A |
| Maximum output from battery back | 5.2 V fully charged | 5.3 V (USB), 20 V DC OUT |
| Maximum output intensity from battery | 1.6 A on 1 USB port | 4 A under 20 V |
