The KoomBook updates automatically once it is connected to the internet.  It does not require any further action on your part.

For more information, you can go to one of the following pages: [How much data does the KoomBook use?](combien-le-koombook-consomme-de-donnees-internet) or [How can I connect the KoomBook to the internet?](comment-connecter-le-koombook-a-internet).
