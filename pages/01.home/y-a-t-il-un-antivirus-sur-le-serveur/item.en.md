No antivirus software is installed on the device, as it is unlikely that the linux system would be infected by a virus.

Nonetheless, it is imortant to be vigilant and pay attention to the documents present in the media center.  The documents suggested by BSF (Libraries Without Borders) co-exist with documents created and proposed by users of the KoomBook.  This second type of document could potentially carry a virus, so stay vigilant.

1. Verify the name of the document that you are going to read/use/download
2. Verify that your computer has updated anti-virus software
