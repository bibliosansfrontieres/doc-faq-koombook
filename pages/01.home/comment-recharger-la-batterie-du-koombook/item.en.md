There are several ways to recharge the battery of your KoomBook

## With a USB 220/110-V -&gt; 5-V Charger

The KoomBook can be charged by using a USB 5-V / 2-A charger.  There is one provided with the KoomBook:

Put the micro USB into the port on the back of the KoomBook (the port on the left below).  **WARNING** Make sure the USB is oriented correctly.  Don't try to force it into the port.
