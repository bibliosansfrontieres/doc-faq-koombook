The latest generation KoomBook (power button with a white LED light) indicates an update's status to the user.  

## Solid LED Light
**The KoomBook is in the process of turning on, or in the middle of an update**

The KoomBook will begin to update two minutes after being connected to the internet, whether via Ethernet or WiFi.  Once the update has started, the LED light will become solid, and will not blink anymore.  Once the update is completed, the light will start blinking again.

The update can take anywhere from 15 minutes to several hours, depending on the quantity of the size of the update.

During the update, you can continue to use the KoomBook.  However, you may notice slower speeds, and some services will be automatically restarted during the update.  The KoomBook's WiFi connection may also temporarily be lost.  Thus, we recommend you do not attempt to carry out important tasks while the KoomBook is updating.

## Blinking LED Light
**The KoomBook is functioning normally**

The KoomBook is functioning normally, and no update is underway.  Users can connect to the KoomBook's WiFi.
