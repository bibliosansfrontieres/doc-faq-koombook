### There are two versions of the KoomBook that exist

#### For the version with the White LED Light:

Press the power button for 3 seconds to start the shut down process.  It will take several seconds before the KoomBook completely turns off. 

#### For the version with the Blue LED Light:
It is not possible to turn off the KoomBook directly via the power button.  You must instead use the Ideascube administration interface.

Connect to the WiFi from the KoomBook or IdeasBox, and go to whichever address applies: http://koombook.lan or http://ideasbox.lan

Click **login**, which can be found at the top right of the web page.

>>>>>**WE DO NOT RECOMMEND** forcing the KoomBook to turn off by pressing the power button.  Doing so may cause irreperable damage to the operating system.  

You will know the KoomBook has shut down once the blue LED light turns off.
