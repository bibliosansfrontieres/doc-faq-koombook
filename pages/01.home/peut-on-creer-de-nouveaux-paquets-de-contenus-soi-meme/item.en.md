It is not currently possible to create new content packs yourself.  The process of selection and creation is still complex and requires a lot of manual operation.

It is, however, possible to manually add content (item by item) to the [Ideascube media center](http://ideascube.doc.bibliosansfrontieres.org/en/administrateur/ajout-contenu).
